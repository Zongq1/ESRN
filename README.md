# ESRN: Emergent Symbolic Reasoning Network

> Learning Local Rules for Global Intelligence

## 🎯 Project Vision

ESRN aims to bridge neural and symbolic AI by learning **local transformation rules** that emerge into **global reasoning capabilities**. Inspired by how simple local rules create complex behaviors in cellular automata, we propose a novel neural-symbolic framework where:

- Neural networks learn symbolic evolution rules (not end-to-end mappings)
- Simple local rules compose into complex reasoning chains
- The reasoning process is interpretable and verifiable

## 🏗️ Project Status

## 🧠 Core Idea

Traditional Approach: Input → [Black Box Neural Network] → Output

ESRN Approach: Input → [Symbol Encoder] → [Learn Local Rules] → [Iterative Reasoning] → Output ↓ ↓ ↓ Discrete States Interpretable Traceable Process

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. Can neural networks learn **interpretable symbolic rules** instead of black-box mappings?
2. Do simple local rules **emerge** into complex global reasoning?
3. Can this framework **generalize** across visual, linguistic, and mathematical reasoning?
